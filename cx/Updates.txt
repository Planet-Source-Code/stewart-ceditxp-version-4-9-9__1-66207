Updates
-------------------------------------

As of right now the editor is fairly near the the same
level of the original VB cEdit though it totally lacks
docking support and as it stands I don't see it being
added because of it's flaws.

Minor drawing bug fix taken care of today.  Redrew the
tabs involving the side nav bar and the MDI Tabs

FTP has been taken care of.

Added a new event to the Highlighters control to readily
know when a highlighter change has occurred.
