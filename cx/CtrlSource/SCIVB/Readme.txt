For those of you not already aware Scintilla is a source editing
component written in C++ and wrapped in the form of a DLL.  It
is available freely from http://www.scintilla.org.  It is updated
regularly with new features, bug fixes and enhancements.  

This ActiveX control is a non visual component which wraps 
Scintilla's features into an easy to use control.  It also provides
easy access to many features supported by Scintilla such as 
AutoComplete, Code Tips, Folding, Syntax Highlighting, and more.

It comes in the form of two non visual components.  The first is
the actual Scintilla Wrapper.  The second smaller control provides
a basic binary style file format and support for setting the style
settings and several other options to scintilla.  It also includes
an ExportToHTML function.

This control set is free to use for personal or commercial
applications, provided some credit is given to it's original authors.

New Highlighter files will periodicly be added at:
http://scivb.sourceforge.net. 

If you create a new Highlighter file you can submit it via email at
the above URL for inclusion on the main site.

Please refer to documentation for support on utilizing this control,
and if you need further assistance please consult the provided forums
