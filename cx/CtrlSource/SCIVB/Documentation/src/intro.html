For those of you who don't already know Scintilla is a source
code editing component written in C++ wrapped into a dll.  It provides
many excellent features, and costs nothing.  <BR><BR>
The only thing that makes it difficult for most VB programmers is the difficulty of implimenting it, and then using it. 
This ActiveX control is designed from the ground up to be as simple to use as possible and expose most of the features
found within the scintilla control.  <BR><BR>
Please feel free to utilize this control is any kind of application, and if you wish to modify the source.  All I ask
is that you please credit your sources.<BR><BR>
Enjoy :)
